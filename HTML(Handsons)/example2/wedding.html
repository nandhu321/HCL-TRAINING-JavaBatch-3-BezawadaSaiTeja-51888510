    <h3>Make your D-day a fresh and Cherishable memory to you and your beloved ones</h3>

        Marriage is the eternal bondage of two opposite gender. This event comes at a time of every humanâ€™s life.
         This day is mostly observed by the people of various castes and creeds. In this respect, I had an opportunity to enjoy the feast and festivities that were provided on the occasion of the wedding ceremony

        The bridegroom party arrived at our house in the evening at 8.00 pm. Then the bridal guests were given sits with great decorum. The bridegroom had his special seat prepared and decorated for him. 
        About five hundred guests attended the ceremony. After a short time, the guests were treated to sumptuous dinner. After having dinner, the guests went for relaxation. They left their respective seats and entered upon friendly gossips in small groups. The party left the place at 10 pm with the bride. I felt much delighted that the occasion gave me the opportunity to meet many in one place and to enjoy a pleasant evening.
