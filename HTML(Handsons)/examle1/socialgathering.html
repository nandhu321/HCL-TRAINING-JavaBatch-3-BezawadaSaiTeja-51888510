    <h2>Birthday Party</h2>
    <h3>Get ready for the bash..</h3>
    <p>
        Celebrating of birthday has become a part and parcel of our life. My parents celebrate my birthday every year . This year I had a special program for its celebration.
        I invited about fifty friends and relatives. They brought me beautiful and costly presents.

        The drawing room of our house was tastefully decorated. Chairs and tables were laid for the guests. A big birthday candle. I cut the cake with a knife. All present programs. Some of my friends sang sweet song. Some showed dance.
         My relatives garlanded me. I felt very proud on that day. I looked like a prince.  In the end we had a light refreshment. My parents blessed me and my relatives and friends wished me long life. This was one of the happiest days of my life.
